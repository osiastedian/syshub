SentryNode owners vote on the proposals using voting technology embedded in the Syscoin blockchain (accessible via the Qt wallet or syshub.org). At the end of the monthly voting period funds are distributed to the proposals with the greatest number of positive votes. Successful projects tend to be those that support and advance Syscoin Platform, such as marketing initiatives and application development.',
