# Production environment variables for Create React App
#
# IMPORTANT: PUBLIC_URL Configuration
# ====================================
# PUBLIC_URL must be set to "/" to ensure assets load correctly on ALL Vercel deployments.
# This includes production (syshub.vercel.app) AND branch preview URLs.
#
# Create React App uses the PUBLIC_URL to determine asset paths in the built HTML.
# When PUBLIC_URL is set to a specific domain (e.g., https://syshub.vercel.app),
# assets are hardcoded to that domain and will fail on branch deployments.
#
# CRITICAL: If Vercel has PUBLIC_URL set as an environment variable, it will override
# this file. You MUST remove PUBLIC_URL from Vercel's environment variables or set it
# to "/" there.
#
# To fix in Vercel:
# 1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Remove PUBLIC_URL or set it to "/"
# 3. Redeploy
#
PUBLIC_URL=/
