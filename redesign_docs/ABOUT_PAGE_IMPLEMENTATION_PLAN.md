# ABOUT PAGE REDESIGN - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Overview
Transform the About page from a traditional timeline-based layout to a modern, card-based design with toggle-controlled sections and refined visual hierarchy, matching the Figma redesign specifications.

---

## Key Design Changes

### 1. Hero Section
- **Current**: InnerBanner with basic heading
- **New**: Large hero with "Learn about Syscoin SentryNodes" heading, full description, and illustration on right
- **Content from Figma** (Translation keys):
  - Title: `about.hero.title` = "Learn about Syscoin SentryNodes"
  - Description: `about.hero.description` = "Syscoin SentryNodes protect the blockchain from network attacks, in the same vein as traditional proof of stake algorithms. It's often expensive to accumulate enough of a currency to create a masternode. This expense helps keep the network decentralised, as it would take an ungodly amount of money to purchase enough currency to have a monopoly on its nodes. The cost of operating a Sentry Node also keeps operators honest. Unlike Bitcoin miners, who may switch from one coin on its blockchain to the next based on profitability, operators are incentivised to properly maintain and upkeep their Syscoin SentryNodes. The exorbitant initial investment serves as collateral, whereby if operators want their investment to pay off, they have to play by the blockchain's rules. Between the high operation costs and promising return on investment, it's in an operator's best interest to operate his/her node properly and without any malicious intent."

### 2. Feature Cards Section (NEW)
- **Location**: After hero, before governance
- **Layout**: 4-card responsive grid
- **Content from Figma** (Translation keys):
  - Title: `about.features.title` = "What sets Syscoin SentryNodes apart?"
  - Card 1: `about.features.list.f1` = "Facilitation of future Syscoin features and services"
    - Icon: `/public/assets/images/about-icons/about-feature-facilitation.png`
  - Card 2: `about.features.list.f2` = "Seniority benefits to masternode operators"
    - Icon: `/public/assets/images/about-icons/about-feature-seniority.png`
  - Card 3: `about.features.list.f3` = "Z-DAG Protocol's instant asset transfer"
    - Icon: `/public/assets/images/about-icons/about-feature-zdags.png`
  - Card 4: `about.features.list.f4` = "Scalability"
    - Icon: `/public/assets/images/about-icons/about-feature-scalability.png`
- **Features**: Icons (100x100px), hover states, responsive stacking (4 cols → 2 cols → 1 col)
- **Icon Details**: Black/grayscale 3D illustration style, positioned at top of each card

### 3. Seniority Section (MAJOR REFACTOR)
- **Current**: Vertical timeline with alternating left/right blocks
- **New**: Multi-part section with TX Data blocks and two-column detail cards
- **Content from Figma** (Translation keys):
  - Title: `about.seniority.title` = "SENTRY NODE SENIORITY EXPLAINED"
  - Description: `about.seniority.description` = "It's been noted that Syscoin price fluctuations may in turn cause fluctuations in the number of masternodes running on the network..."
  - **TX Data Block**: `about.seniority.blockInfo.label` = "Syscoin Average Block is 60 Seconds. Therefore:"
    - `about.seniority.txData.gamma.label` = "TX DATA GAMMA" → `about.seniority.txData.gamma.blocks` = "43,800 Blocks"
    - `about.seniority.txData.beta.label` = "TX DATA BETA" → `about.seniority.txData.beta.blocks` = "526,600 Blocks"
    - `about.seniority.txData.alpha.label` = "TX DATA ALPHA" → `about.seniority.txData.alpha.blocks` = "1,314,000 Blocks"
  - **Two Column Cards**:
    - Left: `about.seniority.oneYear.title` = "1 YEAR 35% increase of base rate"
    - Right: `about.seniority.twoAndHalf.title` = "2.5 YEARS 100% increase of base rate"
  - **Final Note**: `about.seniority.note.main` = Combined seniority note explaining it's based on Transaction Block Height

### 4. Governance Section (Style & Layout Updates)
- **Content from Figma** (Translation keys):
  - Title: `about.governance.title` = "Decentralized Governance"
  - Subtitle: `about.governance.question` = "How does Decentralized Governance work?"
  - Description: `about.governance.description.d1` = "Each month a pot of governance funding is generated by the Syscoin blockchain 'superblock'... [full combined description including decline schedule]"
- **New Layout**:
  - Left side: Governance chart with grid lines showing superblock amount decline over months
  - Right side: Description text
  - Chart axes: Y = "Superblock Amount" (0-1,500,000), X = "Months" (0-25+)

### 5. Rewards Section (Style & Layout Updates)
- **Content from Figma** (Translation keys):
  - Title: `about.rewards.title` = "Rewards"
  - Description: `about.rewards.description.d1` = "75% of each regular block reward is distributed to Sentry Node operators..."
  - Description: `about.rewards.description.d2` = "As a seniority benefit, Sentry Node operators receive a 35% bonus..."
- **New Layout**:
  - Left side: Description text
  - Right side: Reward chart showing masternode reward increase over operational time (0-32+ months)
  - Chart shows +35% at 1 year, +100% at 2.5 years with labeled milestone cards

## Notes

- All components should use existing project patterns and utilities
- Maintain consistency with current design system (Bootstrap 5, existing colors)
- All new code should follow project conventions (React class/functional, i18n usage)
- Responsive design is critical - test at 375px, 768px, 1440px+ breakpoints
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing translations
- All translation strings are now available in the codebase - ready for component implementation
